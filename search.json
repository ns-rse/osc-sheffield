    "text": "Hi, I’m Neil Shephard, and I’m a Research Software Engineer in the Research Software Engineering Team within the Computer Science Department. I’m not hear today to talk to you about software, but about building an Open Scholarship Community in Sheffield.\nBy way of background I studied Zoology and Genetics back in 95-98 here at Sheffield, then Post-graduate research in Genetic Epidemiology 00-01. I’ve worked as a Genetics Statistician for 10 years at University of Manchester, Western Australia and back here in Sheffield University and then spent a decade working as a Medical Statistician in the Clinical Trials Unit within ScHARR. I had a few years working in industry on Teletmatics before returning to University of Sheffield last year to the role I’m currently in."
