    "text": "Hi, I’m Neil Shephard, and I’m a Research Software Engineer in the Research Software Engineering Team within the Computer Science Department. I’m not hear today to talk to you about software, but about building an Open Scholarship Community in Sheffield.\nBy way of background I studied Zoology and Genetics back in 95-98 here at Sheffield, then Post-graduate research in Genetic Epidemiology 00-01. I’ve worked as a Genetics Statistician for 10 years at University of Manchester, Western Australia and back here in Sheffield University and then spent a decade working as a Medical Statistician in the Clinical Trials Unit within ScHARR. I had a few years working in industry on Teletmatics before returning to University of Sheffield last year to the role I’m currently in.\nI developed an early interest in reproducibility many years ago when I quickly tired of re-creating tables and copying and pasting figures into documents and taught myself literate programming with LaTeX and in time other systems. Despite being author on a number of papers that are Open Access and adopting Git to version control my code during my time working as a Medical Statistician the code that underpinned the research was never formally published.\nI’m passionate about open science and saw an opportunity to learn more and help innovate via Open Science Communities and am here to talk that today."

    "text": "Why Communities?\n\nNosek (2019) Strategy for Culture Change\n\nThis is a diagram from an article by Brian Nosek, one of the co-founders of the Center for Open Science and represents how to bring about culture and behaviour change.\nInfrastructure is at the base of the pyramid of culture and behaviour change and there are systems in place such as the Open Science Framework and Octopus which is being developed by JISC. Both of which allow (or will) researchers to register their studies, share materials and data (optionally protecting sensitive data) and share outcomes at any point in the study to accelerate communication regardless of publication.\nThe user interface and experience of using these tools needs to be low friction to encourage adoption and many popular services such as GitHub and Docker are integrated.\nFrom the top of the pyramid is policy and incentives which address the reward system and these are changing towards incentivising open research practices, but we’re not there yet as these practices are not the norm within many places and it is communities that help bridge or fill this gap. Because when people see others undertaking and engaging with open research practices in a visible manner it helps accelerate adoption."

    "text": "What are Communities?\n“a dynamic, social grouping where members align around a shared purpose (or multiple overlapping purposes) and participate in a shared culture. Active community participation frequently aligns with a sense of belonging and affiliation to the community. In a community the flow of information is multi-directional with members able to do something as a result of being connected to one another that they would not be able to do alone.”\n\nI think before going further its worth defining what a community is and this quote from the Center for Scientific Collaboration and Community Engagement gives a clear definition."

    "text": "Diffusion of Innovation\n\n\nWhen any innovative technology or practice comes along you will typically encounter this sort of pattern of diffusion where there are a few innovators who develop the system, slightly more early adopters will pick things up soon after, and following them there is the early majority where uptake really picks up. Unfortunately there is still a large proportion of people who have a propensity to resist, some low, the late majority, some higher, the laggards.\nBy normalising open research practices through building of an active community we accelerate and lower the bar to reaching the early and late majority and the laggards."

    "text": "The Power of Peer-to-Peer\n\nLess intimidating\nExperience > Expertise\nPractical > Theoretical\nSpecificity\nParticipation is the key\n\n\nPeer-to-peer teaching can be far less intimidating than formal teaching environments and it lowers the threshold for asking for help when it is felt that the community is supportive and encouraging.\nVery often experience is more important than expertise. I speak from experience that knowing a system really well means that you can often overlook certain aspects that you take for granted and that someone new to a system might struggle to understand or use. When I started learning to use Git for version control collaboratively my colleagues talked about it as though I already understood what rebasing was, but it was a completely new concept coming from a situation where I had only ever used Git on my own.\nIn a similar vein sharing practical experience of how to use tools is often more beneficial than deep theoretical explanations. There can often be many aspects that might be covered in theoretical material that aren’t relevant to someone getting started.\nIn the same vein the more specific a topic is the better, it ensure that the necessary detail is covered and that it is relevant to those attending which improves engagement.\nThey key to the community really is about participation though and peer-to-peer interactions help promote this."

Members in specific domains are better positioned to engage with and inspire their peers. It is important to have representatives from all faculties to encourage wide-spread adoption and avoid any one group from feeling excluded or that Open Scholarship isn’t for them.\nThe community is meant to be an independent, bottom-up, self-governing and self-steering group, not determined by institutional policies but should cooperate with the existing structures for Open Research, library efforts and so forth and should work with existing groups such as the FAIR Roadmap Working Group, Reproucibilitea and the Data Visualisation hub to name but a few.\nIts aimed at all staff, not just researchers but support staff and administrators."

This makes it easy for people to find others who have experience in an area they are looking to learn more about.\nFurther regular workshops on different topics would be undertaken allowing people not just to learn about different aspects of open research but to meet and chat to others working in the area. Its important to have the opportunity to meet and talk in an informal setting as it can lead to useful collaboration and cross-pollination.\nTo augment this it would be useful to have a forum for asking and answering questions of the community about different topics. This would over time develop a consistent set of material which could be referenced and underpin the development of more structured and formal documentation such as FAQs on particular topics.\nPerhaps one of the most useful aspects of joining the International Network of Open Science Communities is that there are other groups who have already gone through the experience of setting up communities and we can tap into that knowledge base as sharing of material and experiences is strongly encouraged and my experience so far from the course is that Loek and Annita who are running it are really passionate and supportive about community building."
