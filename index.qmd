::: {.notes}
Hi, I'm Neil Shephard, and I'm a Research Software Engineer in the Research Software Engineering Team within the
Computer Science Department. I'm not hear today to talk to you about software, but about building an Open Scholarship
Community in Sheffield.

By way of background I studied Zoology and Genetics back in 95-98 here at Sheffield, then Post-graduate research in
Genetic Epidemiology 00-01. I've worked as a Genetics Statistician for 10 years at University of Manchester, Western
Australia and back here in Sheffield University and then spent a decade working as a Medical Statistician in the
Clinical Trials Unit within ScHARR. I had a few years working in industry on Teletmatics before returning to University
of Sheffield last year to the role I'm currently in.

I developed an early interest in reproducibility many years ago when I quickly tired of re-creating tables and copying
and pasting figures into documents and taught myself literate programming with LaTeX and in time other systems. Despite
being author on a number of papers that are Open Access and adopting Git to version control my code during my time
working as a Medical Statistician the code that underpinned the research was never formally published.

I'm passionate about open science and saw an opportunity to learn more and help innovate via Open Science Communities
and am here to talk that today.

## OSC Incubator Programme


+ [Syllabus v1.2](https://www.osc-international.com/)
+ Nurture and grow Open Science/Scholarship Communities around the world.
+ Share resources and ideas to facilitate uptake.
+ [PLACEHOLDER]

## Open Science/Scholarship Communities

+ OSCs are part of [International Network of Open Science Communities](https://www.osc-international.com/) (INOSC)
+ Started at Utrecht University in Netherlands
+ Grew to others in Netherlands
+ ...and beyond
+ Now seeking to further expand international network.

## Culture and Behaviour Change

![](img/COS_Culture_and_Behavior_Change_model.png)

[Nosek (2019) Strategy for Culture Change](img/COS_Culture_and_Behavior_Change_model.png)

::: {.notes}
Infrastrcuture is at the base of the pyramid of culture and behaviour and there are systems in place such as the Open
Science Framework and Octopus which is being developed by JISC. Both of which allow (or will) researchers to register
their studies, share materials and data (optionally protecting sensitive data) and share outcomes at any point in the
study to accelerate communication regardless of publication.

The user interface and experience of using these tools needs to be low friction to encourage adoption and many popular
services such as GitHub and Docker are integrated.

From the top of the pyramid is policy and incentives which address the reward system and these are changing towards
incentivising open research practices, but we're not there yet as these practices are not the norm within many places
and it is communities that help bridge or fill this gap. Because when people see others undertaking and engaging with
open research practices in a visible manner it helps accelerate adoption.

## Connecting People

> _When one person teaches, two people learn._

+ Range of career stages and skills/knowledge/experience.
+ Sharing knowledge between researchers to learn from each other.

## Diffusion of Innovation

![](img/diffusion_innovation.png)

::: {.notes}
When any innovative technology or practice comes along you will typically encounter this sort of pattern of diffusion
where there are a few innovators who develop the system, slightly more early adopters will pick things up soon after,
and following them there is the early majority where uptake really picks up. Unfortunately there is still a large
proportion of people who have a propensity to resist, some low, the late majority, some higher, the laggards.

By normalising open research practices through building of an active community we accelerate and lower the bar to
reaching the early and late majority and the laggards.

## Structure

+ Core Team of active members, inclusive and diverse.
+ Independent, bottom-up, self-governing, self-steering.
+ Not determined by institutional policies but should collaborate with institutional Open Research programmes, libraries
  and so forth.
+ Work with existing groups such as the FAIR Roadmap Working Group.
+ Aimed towards researchers, support staff and administrators.

::: {.notes}
The governance or structure of the Open Scholarship Community consists of a core team of active members which should be
inclusive and diverse, with members from all faculties represented. Members in specific domains are better positioned to
engage with and inspire their peers. It is important to have representatives from all faculties to encourage wide-spread
adoption and avoid any one group from feeling excluded or that Open Scholarship doesn't fir their needs.

The community is meant to be an independent, bottom-up, self-governing and self-steering group, not determined by
institutional policies but should cooperate with the existing structures for Open Research, library efforts and so
forth and should work with existing groups such as the FAIR Roadmap
:::

## Activities and Formats

+ Members have profiles pages highlighting experience.
+ Workshops on specific topics.
+ Reuse material from existing OSCs strongly encouraged.
