::: {.notes}
Hi, I'm Neil Shephard, and I'm a Research Software Engineer in the Research Software Engineering Team within the
Computer Science Department. I'm not hear today to talk to you about software, but about building an Open Scholarship
Community in Sheffield.

By way of background I studied Zoology and Genetics back in 95-98 here at Sheffield, then Post-graduate research in
Genetic Epidemiology 00-01. I've worked as a Genetics Statistician for 10 years at University of Manchester, Western
Australia and back here in Sheffield University and then spent a decade working as a Medical Statistician in the
Clinical Trials Unit within ScHARR. I had a few years working in industry on Teletmatics before returning to University
of Sheffield last year to the role I'm currently in.

## Diffusion of Innovation

## Governance

+ Core Team of active members
+ Independent, bottom-up, self-governing, self-steering.
+ Not determined by institutional policies but should collaborate with institutional Open Research programmes, libraries
  and so forth.


## Connecting People

> When one person teaches, two people learn.

+ Sharing
